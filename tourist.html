          <h2>SAINT ANNE PARISH CHURCH</h2>
          <p>
            In 1810, the parish was founded by Augustinian friars. The first parish priest was Fr. Isidro Champaner. During the Philippine-American War, the building was inhabited by a 5-man Filipino guerilla group who repelled early American attacks. On 19 March 1932, an earthquake toppled the top level of the bell tower. The church underwent repairs afterward. During the Japanese occupation, the convent and the sacristy together with its parochial records, furniture and statues were burned. The facade and its interior were restored in 1965.The convent was repaired and converted into a parochial school.

          <h2>BASI REVOLT</h2>
          <p>
            The Basi Revolt is a symbol of  heroic movement of the Ilocanos  love for Basi particularly in Piddig, Ilocos Norte. The Basi Revolution happened during the Spanish era, when the government forbid the private manufacturers to sell Basi in the public and force the market (the people) to buy Basi from the government. The Basi revolt never succeeded but it serves as stepping stone for achieving freedom. It  deserves a recognition among Ilocanos because it reminds them their ancestors culture and story of preserving the Piddiguenos history. This is then engraved in a limestone that is installed in the monument of Basi revolt.
