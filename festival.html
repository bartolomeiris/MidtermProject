              <h1>BASI FESTIVAL OF PIDDIG</h1>
              <p>
                Piddig is known for its place in the Basi Revolt, led by Pedro Mateo, a native of Piddig. This revolt is unique as it revolves around the Ilocanoâ€™s love for basi or sugarcane wine, hence, Piddig is known for the best basi in Ilocos.
                Basi is the local beverage of Ilocos in Northern Luzon where it
                has been consumed since before the Spanish conquest. This
                product is produced by first crushing sugarcane and extracting the juice.
                The juice is boiled in vats and then stored in earthen jars. Once the juice has cooled, flavorings made of ground glutinous rice, duhat(java plum) bark and other fruits, barks, and leaves are added. The jars are then sealed with banana leaves and allowed to ferment for several years. The resulting drink is pale red in color. If fermented longer, it
                turns into suka or vinegar.
                The 1807 Basi Revolt in Piddig, Ilocos Norte occurred when the Spanish rulers banned the private manufacture of the
                beverage. However, wine-loving Ilocanos in Piddig rose in revolt on September 16, 1807, with the revolt spreading through towns and with fighting lasting for weeks.
                Nowadays, the traditional Basi Festival in Piddig, Ilocos Norte has been celebrated every 16th of September.
